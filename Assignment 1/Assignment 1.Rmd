# Problem 1 (40 Points)
50 students registered for a mechanical design course. Their names are given in the course roster that can be accessed by the professor. The details of their names are given in the file titled “roster.csv”. The names are printed as “last name, first name” format. A snapshot of the roster data is given below.

When the students attend a lecture they enter the attendance for each class using an online form. The form records their first name and last name. The attendance data is given in the file titled “attendance.csv”. A snapshot of the student attendance data is given below.

## Tasks

1. Read the two data files in R studio
```{r Read Files, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Original Files
origin_roster <- read_csv("roster.csv")
origin_attendance <- read_csv("attendance.csv")
  
# Copy Data Frames to Modify
roster <- origin_roster
attendance <- origin_attendance
```
2. Write a code to aggregate attendance, i.e., how many lectures were attended by each student. If a student has not attended any lectures, set the value as zero. The code should be effective in case of multiple instances of the same first name or last name (or both). These values must be updated in the roster.
```{r Aggregate, warning=FALSE}
# Combine first and last name to match up with roster, create new column
attendance$fullname <- paste(attendance$lastname, attendance$firstname, sep=", ")
    
# Create new data frame using a table which gets the counts of the names
attendance_count <- as.data.frame(table(attendance$fullname))
colnames(attendance_count) <- c("names", "freq")

# Put values into roster, use match() to match the names from the two datasets
roster$Count <- attendance_count$freq[match(roster$names, attendance_count$names)]

# Where values are NA, mark attendance as 0
roster$Count[is.na(roster$Count)] <- 0

# Separate first and last names, reorder the columns to print first name before last name
roster <- roster %>% separate(names, c("Last Name", "First Name"), sep = ", ")
roster <- roster[, c(2, 1, 3)]
```
3. The output of the code should generate a roster data frame as given below. 

First Name    | Last Name | Count
--------------| ----------| -----
Bob           | Ross      | 4
Ron           | Swanson   | 0

```{r Output}
roster
```
# Problem 2
From the “wine_data.csv", answer the following questions using data wrangling functions from relevant packages
```{r wine csv}
wine_data <- read_csv("wine_data.csv")
```
1. Write a code to calculate the frequency count of “variety” variable from the dataset. Display top 10 variety by count (**10 points**)
```{r frequency}
# Create table, change column names
var_freq <- as.data.frame(table(wine_data$variety))
colnames(var_freq) <- c("variety", "freq")

# Get top 10 values, and arrange in descending order
var_freq %>% 
  top_n(10, freq) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq))
```
2. Write a code to calculate the average points by country (**10 points**)
```{r Average Points}
wine_data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(avg_points = mean(points)) 
```
3. Which province has the highest average price? (**10 points**)
```{r Average Price}
# Modify data frame to get average price based off province
price <- wine_data %>% 
  group_by(province) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = T))

# Print province with highest average price
price %>% top_n(1, avg_price)
```
4. Which province in the US has the highest average price? (**10 points**)
```{r Province}
# Modify data frame, where the country must be the US
US_price <- wine_data[wine_data$country == "US",] %>%
  group_by(province) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = T))

# Print US province with highest average price
US_price %>% top_n(1, avg_price)
```
5. From the “designation” variable calculate the number of 20 year old wine (**20 points**)
```{r 20 Years}
# Use filter() and grepl() to get wines with 20 years in their description
wine20 <- wine_data %>% 
  filter(grepl("20-Year|20-year|20-Years|20 Anos|20 Year|20 Years|20-Year-Old|20 yr.
               |20 Yr.|20th Anniversary|20 Anni", wine_data$designation))
    
# Count total rows
count(wine20)
```
